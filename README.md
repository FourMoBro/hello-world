# hello-world
This is the baseline/status repository. I plan to have many repositories to store all the learning I am doing through udemy classes or from books. I hope to learn various git skills and transfer these skills to my daughters.

In addition to my own learning, I hope to build an online presence. I hope to leverage the workflows of git to help manage changes to files which will be used during the FLL and FTC robotics seasons.

Stay Tuned!
